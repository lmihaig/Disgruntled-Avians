# Disgruntled Avians 

**Disgruntled Avians** is a 2D roguelike knock-off of Angry Birds, heavily inspired by [Peglin](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1296610/Peglin/). It is also my first video game project and serves as an experiment to learn gamedev and specifically the Godot Engine and GDS language.
